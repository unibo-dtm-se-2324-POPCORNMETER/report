# Popcorn Meter

Popcorn Meter is a desktop/web movie recommendation application with a Streamlit GUI, developed in Python for a University Software Engineering project, built using Streamlit, Poetry, OMDb integration, and the template provided by the University course.

---

Discover movies, build your watchlist, track watched titles, and get personalized recommendations based on your preferences and activity.

The application combines:
- account-based preferences and history
- OMDb movie metadata
- explainable recommendation logic (genres, actors, ratings, plot signals, and feedback)

Popcorn Meter runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
